# JAX-FEM

A differentiable 3D finite element solver for automatic inverse design and mechanistic data science.


## To-do

1. Cauchy boundary conditions
2. Periodic boundary conditions (linear constraints)
3. Interfacing with linear solvers like PETSc
4. Logging, color prints
 

## Remarks

Units are [s] [kg] [mm] unless otherwise specified.
